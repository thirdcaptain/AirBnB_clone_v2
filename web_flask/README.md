### models/engine/file_storage.py, models/engine/db_storage.py, models/state.py
update FileStorage to to deserialize JSON file
update DBStorage with close(self) method that calls remove on private session attribute
update State with getter method to return list of City objects from storage linked to the current state

### web_flask/7-states_list.py, web_flask/templates/7-states_list.html
A script that starts a Flask application
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/states_list: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>
Import this 7-dump to have some data

### web_flask/8-cities_by_states.py, web_flask/templates/8-cities_by_states.html
A script that starts a Flask application
use the public getter method cities
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/cities_by_states: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B> + UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>
Import this 7-dump to have some data

### web_flask/10-hbnb_filters.py, web_flask/templates/10-hbnb_filters.html, web_flask/static/
A script that starts a Flask application
To load all cities of a State:
If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/hbnb_filters: display a HTML page like 6-index.html, which was done during the project 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
Copy files 3-footer.css, 3-header.css, 4-common.css and 6-filters.css from web_static/styles/ to the folder web_flask/static/styles
Copy files icon.png and logo.png from web_static/images/ to the folder web_flask/static/images
Update .popover class in 6-filters.css to allow scrolling in the popover and a max height of 300 pixels.
Use 6-index.html content as source code for the template 10-hbnb_filters.html:
